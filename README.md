## Overview

This web app grabs your camera feed and streams it full-screen with a slick glowing neon vibe. It lets you toggle between multiple cameras, slap on some rad filters, and record video with audio. You can pause/resume recording and save your masterpiece locally as a `.webm` file. The UI slides in from the side and can be toggled with a keyboard shortcut for that ultra-smooth workflow.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut   | Action                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| `Ctrl + O` | Toggle options menu open/close |

---

## Compatibility

* Designed to run on modern **desktop browsers** with support for:

  * `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia`
  * `MediaRecorder` API
* Tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge desktop versions
* Not supported on mobile browsers (detects and displays a warning)

---

## Known Limitations

* No backend â€” all recording & saving happens client-side
* Limited to `.webm` video format
* Audio input is always from the default microphone paired with the camera feed; no separate audio device selector
* Some browsers may block or limit camera access without HTTPS
* Mobile device support is intentionally blocked due to constraints

---

## Future Improvements (Ideas, cuz why not innovate?)

* Add video format export options (e.g., MP4 via client-side transcoding)
* Include separate audio device selector
* Add ability to save recordings directly to cloud storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
* Implement advanced filter controls (sliders for intensity, combos)
* UI/UX polish: draggable/resizable options panel, dark/light mode toggle
* Support for mobile devices with adapted UI and fallback handling

# ðŸš¨ Pro Tip

Make sure youâ€™re testing with HTTPS on localhost or a secure domain â€” browsers get super paranoid about camera access without it.
